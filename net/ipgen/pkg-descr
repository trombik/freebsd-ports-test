ipgen is a packet traffic generator that uses netmap or XDP. It can
interactively output packets of various sizes and rates, and measure how many
have been dropped.

ipgen is implemented using the netmap feature of FreeBSD or the XDP feature of
Linux.

AF_XDP on Linux is developed and tested on Ubuntu 21.04. It should work on
recent Fedora Linux too with some minor tweaks.o
